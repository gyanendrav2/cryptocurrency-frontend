  "limited_subTitle":"Limited supply of XCM",
  "limited_content":"The big difference? We donâ€™t just keep minting or creating new points. There is a limited supply and an active secondary market. This means that people are trading XCM tokens back and forth all the time and this accessible market for XCM means not only do the tokens have a real cash value but that the value can increase overtime.
