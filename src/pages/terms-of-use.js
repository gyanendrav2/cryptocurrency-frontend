          <h4 className="fs22mg mt50">Introduction</h4>
          <div className="mt15">The CoinMetro website (the “<span className="b">Website</span>”) and the CoinMetro platform (the “<span className="b">Platform</span>”) (together “<span className="b">CoinMetro Services</span>”) are owned and operated by CoinMetro OÜ (“<span className="b">We</span>, <span className="b">Our</span>”, “CoinMetro”), a company incorporated with limited liability in the Republic of Estonia with company number 14448371 and registered address at Tartu mnt 84a-402, Tallinn 10112, Republic of Estonia. Each reference in these terms of use to “our Website” and “our Platform” includes all materials that we make available to you on our website.</div>
          <div className="mt15">The CoinMetro Platform is an exchange-based order book for various pairings of digital assets and funds such as euros. When an user places an order, the exchange platform automatically matches the user’s order with orders placed by other users in order to carry out the transaction.</div>
          <div className="mt15">Before using the CoinMetro Platform, you should be aware that the risk of loss in trading or holding digital assets is substantial and that the value of digital assets is subject to extreme volatility. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding digital assets is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.</div>
          <div className="mt15">By using the CoinMetro Services, you agree to comply with these terms of use. Please check this page each time you use our website, as we may update these terms from time to time. The use of certain CoinMetro Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions which you will be asked to read and accept at the relevant time. To the extent of any inconsistency with these terms, the terms of those CoinMetro Services will apply to those Services and any matters connected with them. These terms, together with any additional terms and conditions, set out the basis of which CoinMetro provides access to the CoinMetro Services.</div>
          <div className="mt15">Please read these terms carefully and ensure that you fully understand them, especially with respect to the provisions that exclude or limit our liability and exclude or limit your rights and interests. You are only entitled to have access to the CoinMetro Services after you accept these Terms. If you do not agree to these terms, or refuse to recognise the CoinMetro’s right to make amendment to these terms from time to time, you shall promptly stop using and cease access to the CoinMetro Services. References to any additional terms, policies, articles, clauses or schedules, unless the context otherwise requires, are reference to such documents as modified or replaced from time to time.</div>
          <div className="mt15">You should also be aware that CoinMetro OÜ is a company incorporated in Estonia and it is not regulated by the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority (“<span className="b">EFSA</span>”). CoinMetro has obtained licensing from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (the “<span className="b">FIU</span>”) for the purposes of providing digital currency to fiat exchange services (licence no. FVR000143) and digital currency wallet services (licence no. FRK000121).</div>
